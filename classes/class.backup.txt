    1) Backup::db_export_sql_query() now uses Record::escape_string()

    1) Changes to Backup::db_export_sql_query() and Backup::db_export_sql_data()
       to set sql connection to utf8 -
       default mysql connection in library for php is latin which caused problems
  1.1.3 (2010-06-18)
    1) Changes to Backup::db_export_sql_query() and Backup::db_export_sql_data()
       to export nulls as NULL not \N regardless of field type

  1.0.4 (2007-04-20)
    1) Added drop=true parameter to db_export_sql_structure() to allow export of

  1.0.3 (2007-04-17)
    1) Changes to db_backup() to use Table object to simplify retrieval of variables
       and tidy up headers
  1.0.2 (2007-04-16)
    1) In db_export_sql_structure() now uses SHOW CREATE TABLE instead of doing it the
       hard way - much simpler and much fewer queries required - one plus one per table
       Safe for mysql from 3.23.20 onwards
    2) Now all sql_queries use do_sql_query() to truthfully report data when in debug mode
