  1.0.19 (2012-08-17)
    1) QB_Customer::lookup_from_qb_data() now also checks qb_name for record where
       set so that customers whose QB_Names are given can be matched on the import
       phase instead of waiting for phase 2
    2) New subclass QB_Inventory_Item which extends Product and implements
       QB_Inventory_Item::get_next_ID_for_QB_conversion() formerly in Product class

  1.0.18 (2012-08-15)
    1) Improved logging and now complete elimination of repeated operations
    2) Removed QUICKBOOKS_QUERY_CUSTOMER_BY_QB_NAME and related support -
       now QUICKBOOKS_QUERY_CUSTOMER uses the qb_name (as it should)
    3) Now uses sequence to set workqueue thread priority and eliminates
       hard-coded values in rountines themselves.
  1.0.17 (2012-08-14)
    1) Now works properly with all items in sequence up to customer add
  1.0.16 (2012-08-13)
    1) Now works in three phases - but can't yet run all in one suite.
       First:
         downloads entire QB database in 100-record chunks
         Checks each downloaded record against user database looking for
         QB_Name and QB_Ident and sets these if it finds a reliable unique match
       Second:
         Looks for any remaining web-side customers with orders who have a QB name
         (which will have been manually entered after a manual search) and gets the
         corresponding QB_Ident
       Third:
         Looks for any remaining web-side customers who do not have a QB name
         and creates these in quickbooks.
  1.0.15 (2012-08-10)
    THIS VERSION DOES WORK - But next version needs to handle import from QB in
    smaller blocks then parse and update or insert user records in same thread
    1) QB_Import::get_customer_data() now gets both qb_ident and qb_name
    2) QB_Import::_qbwc_get_customer_qb_idents() now sets both qb_ident and qb_name
  1.0.14 (2012-07-24)
    1) Added QB_Import::get_completed_download()
  1.0.13 (2012-07-19)
    1) Added class qb_import to interact directly with importer data
    2) Now includes QuickBooks::_qbwc_queue_download_all_customers(),
       QuickBooks::_customer_get_all_request() and QuickBooks::_customer_get_all_response()
    3) Data from quickbooks customers is now loaded into a new table qb_data as
       XML chunks in 500 record segments to avoid server timeouts
    4) Still need to post process this to do customer imports to wqebsite after
       checking for duplicates
  1.0.12 (2012-06-28)
    1) Now looks up products and customers in quickkbooks before trying to add
       them
  1.0.11 (2012-06-21)
    1) Code simplification and start of work on product lookups
  1.0.10 (2012-06-13)
    1) Now successfully adds orders - these have a lower queue priority than
       products and customers so dependencies are in place when we need them.
       TODO:
       Mark Orders as paid
       Tag correct tax codes to items
  1.0.9 (2012-06-06)
    1) Changes to QuickBooks::_product_add_request()
       to use itemCode for name, then have title prefix description
  1.0.8 (2012-05-30)
    1) Now respects export settings in system panel to decide what to export
       via web connector
  1.0.7 (2012-05-23)
    1) Now sets up the quickbooks listID of any item queued to 'q' to avoid
       looping indefinately
  1.0.6 (2012-05-23)
    1) Now takes account names and username / password from site settings
  1.0.5 (2012-05-18)
    1) Now has all handlers within main class
    2) Extended to allow for exporting of all unknown products
  1.0.4 (2012-05-09)
    1) Code moded into this standard class file for version control purposes
  1.0.3 (2012-05-02)
    1) Moved from qb/docs/example_server.php to qb/server.php
  1.0.2 (2012-02-22)
  1.0.1 (2012-02-17)
    1) Changes to operate with Ecclesiact environment:
       Globalising $dsn
       Setting include path to shared folder
       Updating person records when quickbooks inserts customer and issues a
       ListID as the primary key
    2) TODO:
       Major tidy up
       Complete real-word code for syncronisation functions
  1.0.0 (?)
