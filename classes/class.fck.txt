       textarea field
  1.0.18 (2012-10-09)
    1) FCK::draw_editor() now sets content of initial textarea dynamically using
       JSON-encoded content immediately after load time so all textarea content

  1.0.17 (2012-10-07)
    1) Tweak to HTML for textarea used to seed FCK Editor now has required rows

  1.0.9 (2010-11-18)
    1) FCK::draw_config() now handles exclusion of media plugins for safari properly
       - Safari APPEARED to work (see placeholder demo for FCKEditor 2.6.6) but
       completely failed to set context in popup when invoked:
         see http://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/2425
       It is noteworthy that sample code shipped with version 3.4.2 doesn't even try
    2) FCK::draw_config() now includes inline video and youtube tag controllers
  1.0.8 (2010-08-14)
    1) FCK::draw_editor() now replaces [ with {{[}} when setting value for control
       and has javascript convert it back to [ client-side.
       This has far-reaching implications:
       a) We can now defeat the ECL tag processing engine when we generate the page
          so now ANY page can be edited using 'in-page' methods, regardless of the
          ECL, audio, youtube or transform tags it may contain
       b) Email wizard content that contains ECL tags can be safely reloaded
          following sender, group or other change without parser attempting to
          interfere with FCKEditor-enclosed content
       TWO significant 'gotchas' now gone!
    2) FCK::draw_editor() no longer shims width by means of a transparent spacer
       image and allows for % values to be given while defaulting to px where
       units are not given for width or height
