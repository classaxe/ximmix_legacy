       favour of combo_listdata with lst_sp that operates on a single field.
       For custom forms - with hundreds of forms and sections defined using this
       field type - this code has been altered to use combo_listdata field type
       but to operate on a single field.
       All extra code that supported the hidden alt field previously associated
       with 'combo_sp_selector' type fields has been removed.

  1.0.23 (2010-11-02)
    1) Custom_Form::xml_form_process_person() now sets an initial randomised
       password whenever a person is created but does NOT send out an email -
       if an email is triggered later by means of an action it has the chance
       to regenerate a password a second time then send that.
       This means that a post-process auto-signin now works.
    2) Removed cp for 'auto_signin' - now assumed always
    3) Custom_Form::actions_execute() now gets personID according to $data[ID']
       NOT currently logged on user - may be an admin proxying required user

       this concept of setting a tax_regime will be abandoned very soon.
  1.0.13 (2010-03-17)
    1) Custom_Form::xml_form_prepare() now uses string concat for output
    2) Added smaller helper functions for Custom_Form::xml_form_prepare() to
       reduce complexity
  1.0.12 (2010-03-12)
    1) Custom_Form::xml_form_prepare() no longer calls draw_js_get_taxes_applied()
       The function placed by this is now universal and lives in functions.js
  1.0.11 (2010-03-12)
    1) Custom_Form::xml_form_prepare() now calls Tax_Regime::set_tax_zone()
    2) Custom_Form::xml_form_process_order() now calls Tax_Regime::set_tax_zone()

       Custom_Form::xml_form_process_order() to deal with changes to constructor

  1.0.9 (2010-02-19)
    1) Removed the following redundant functions which were left in only to
       support HRPYRs golf day registration system plus some pehistoric code
       in CICBV - these are now part of the Custom extender class for hrpyr
       in custom.php if they are ever needed again (doubtful!)
         Custom_Form::frm_hr()
         Custom_Form::frm_control_radio()
         Custom_Form::frm_control_radio_YN()
         Custom_Form::frm_control_radio_YN_group()
         Custom_Form::frm_js_block()
         Custom_Form::frm_js_doVerify()
  1.0.8 (2009-12-16)
    1) Change to Custom_Form::xml_form_process() to force generation of order
       if products are added but admin didn't include hidden 'category' field
       for the actual order in the custom form itself.
  1.0.7 (2009-11-30)

    1) Change to Custom_Form::actions_execute() to fix missing variable
