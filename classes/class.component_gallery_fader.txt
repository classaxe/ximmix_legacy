  1.0.38 (2012-11-10)
    1) Changes to Component_Gallery_Fader::_load_records() to never show disabled

  1.0.29 (2011-06-25)

    1) Subtle refinement to Component_Gallery::draw_fader() to ONLY set the
       container_path for new images IF the container path was specified by the
       fader component itself - otherwise it's probably using categories rather
       than the actual path of any given image seen.

    2) Component_Gallery::draw_fader() now sets max height as $cp['max'] if actual
       maximum image height cannot be established - e.g. where images are all on
       a remote site and shared.
       More work probably needs to be done there.

       for context menu new item creation
