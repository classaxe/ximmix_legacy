  1.0.11 (2012-08-23)
    1) Tweak to Event_Recurrence::promote_first_child() to set recurrence description
       even when there the one remaining recurrence has been converted to stand-alone
  1.0.10 (2012-08-23)
    1) Removed local method Event_Recurrence::children_get() in favour of
       get_children() method defined in Event class (parent)
    2) Change to Event_Recurrence::children_set_recurrence_description() to not
       reveal update date for all items
    3) New method Event_Recurrence::promote_first_child() used in Event::delete
    4) Major changes to split job of setting recurrence fields and job of setting
       recurrence decription into to separate methods to simplify code flow and
       to allow for independent use of Event_Recurrence::set_recurrence_description()
       by Event_Recurrence::promote_first_child()
  1.0.9 (2011-12-23)
    1) Recurrence modifications now selectively delete or insert events as needed
    2) Split out _draw_save() into sub-functions to simplify
  1.0.8 (2011-12-04)
    1) Saving recurrence now sets a 100ms timeout that reloads form and opener
       (if present) which closes popup layer form automatically
  1.0.7 (2011-11-14)
    1) Bug fix in form_field_recurrence_settings() which caused errors on unsaved
       events
  1.0.6 (2011-11-14)
    1) Completed work on date calculations -
       Now correctly handles all day, week, month and year scenarios
    2) Now generates sequences of recurring events but right now it's pretty
       destructive if you resave recurrence settings  -
       old ones are all cleared out and regenerated
  1.0.5 (2011-11-09)
    1) More work on date calculations
  1.0.4 (2011-11-08)
    1) Added code to calculate which new dates are required for repeated events
       Incomplete as yet but a good start.

    1) Usability tweaks and corrections for recurrence settings
    2) Moved Event::form_field_recurrence_settings() into this class
