  1.0.27 (2011-01-04)
    1) Change to call within Product_Catalogue::_draw_item_description() from
       draw_related() to draw_associated() to make this more distrinct from
       'other' use of the term related.
  1.0.26 (2012-01-03)
    1) Changes to Product_Catalogue::_draw_refund_items() to use associative array
       for tracking tax columns in use - this prevents duplication of columns each
       time a new item is added to the refund list.   Closes bug XIM-147
  1.0.25 (2011-12-30)
    1) Changes to Product_Catalogue::_draw_category_heading() and
       Product_Catalogue::_draw_item() to not require popup lookup to tell them
       what report and tooltip text to use (was unsupported two builds ago)
  1.0.24 (2011-12-16)
    1) Changes to Product_Catalogue::_draw_totals_for_order() to show 'Discount'
       where payment method surcharge is negative
  1.0.23 (2011-11-29)
    1) Added new optional args dealing with selection and sizing of image
    2) Changed internal matching for 'thumbnail_small' to 'image'
  1.0.22 (2011-09-14)
    1) Bug fix for Product_Catalogue::_draw_item_description() for when there is
       no related item - i.e. dealing with a regular product by itself
  1.0.21 (2011-09-14)
    1) Modified Product_Catalogue::_draw_item_description() to use whatever
       type is given for related_type and then invoke that directly instead of
       switching on it.
  1.0.20 (2011-09-02)
    1) Product_Catalogue::_draw_item_description() now checks if there is a
       related item and if so calls the item's draw_detail_for_related_item()
       method and prepends the output from that to the content description.
  1.0.19 (2011-08-26)
    1) Changes to Product_Catalogue::_draw_setup_load_product_groupings() for
       table name and column name changes
  1.0.18 (2011-08-25)
    1) Removed all personality code for mode 'checkout'
    2) Removed all personality code for mode 'credit_memo'
    3) Now permanently locked into personality mode 'order_history'
  1.0.17 (2011-08-25)
    1) Turned this class into a base class for personality extenders
    2) Removed all personality code for mode 'shop'
    3) Big changes to _get_columns_for_category() -
       renamed it to _get_columns_for_grouping() and massively simplified it
  1.0.16 (2011-08-25)
    1) Standardised spelling of internal references to catalog to catalogue
    2) Replaced 'catalogue' personality references to 'shop' in preparation for
       splitting personalities to child classes that inherit from this base class
  1.0.15 (2011-08-18)
    1) Deleted recently added Product_Catalogue::update_cart() -
       Now delegated to its own class
  1.0.14 (2011-08-18)
    1) Product_Catalogue::draw() now looks for related_type and related_ID in
       args if given
    2) Change to Product_Catalogue::_draw_item_quantity() to set source URI
       value to related type and ID if given when calling for cart update
  1.0.13 (2010-05-31)
    1) Change to Product_Catalogue::_draw_item_quantity() to have anchors that
       return scroll position to clicked cart or existing hash if set.
  1.0.12 (2010-05-24)
    1) Change to Product_Catalogue::_draw_item_quantity() to simplify JS and move
       this to onclick instead of href
  1.0.11 (2010-04-06)
    1) Moved majority of setup code out of constructor and into new draw()
       helper function - this reduces load when instantiating for version check
    2) Private member variables now prefixed with _ and in standard format
    3) Steps to move calculation code to nearer where it is actually used
       (more loops doing less things but much clearer)
    4) Removed Product_Catalogue::_draw_calc_refund_suggested_total() -
       answer given was completely irrelevant as JS overwrites it immediately
       (with wrong answer, but that's another issue...)
    5) Removed unrequired Product_Catalogue::_get_tax_names_and_rates()
    6) Removed Product_Catalogue::_draw_totals_for_order_history() -
       now uses Product_Catalogue::_draw_totals_for_order() as it does for
       checkout mode
  1.0.10 (2010-03-22)
    1) Reference to $taxRegime->set_tax_zone() now hard-coded to CAN -
       this concept of setting a tax_regime will be abandoned very soon.
  1.0.9 (2010-03-12)
    1) Product_Catalogue::draw() now calls Tax_Regime::set_tax_zone()
  1.0.8 (2010-03-11)
    1) Changes to Product_Catalogue::draw() to deal with changes to
       Tax_Regime constructor (now behaves more like a regular record)
  1.0.7 (2009-11-09)
    1) Change to Product_Catalogue::draw() to get payment method surcharge
       from Payment_Method class
  1.0.6 (2009-10-10)
    1) Removed shipping_gateway option - now handled by means of manditory product instead
    2) Tax rates in tax columns now converted to float - e.g. 5.00 becomes 5
  1.0.5 (2009-10-06)
    1) Product_Catalogue::draw() now includes option for shipping_gateway (not yet implemented)
  1.0.4 (2009-09-29)
    1) Changes to deal with renaming of various fields in product and product category tables
  1.0.3 (2009-08-03)
    1) Bug fix to Product_Catalogue::draw() to only include items in roll-up that
       are not related to refunds or credit memos

    Initial release
