  1.0.10 (2011-03-29)
    1) Navbutton::info() now includes `ID` and `childID_csv` -
       min and max are retained only for use with SD Menus only

       position-dependent overlays to deal with
    3) Navbutton::on_update() now ONLY regernerates sibblings if there were
       position-dependent overlays to deal with or if this is a vertical menu
       with auto-width - manually set width results in update to current item
       only
    4) Now works with true color and outputs a PNG to ensure we have enough
       colours to manage buttion effects
    5) Bug fix for Navbutton::subnav_add() now that navbutton `text` is named `text1`
  1.0.3 (2010-07-23)
    1) Added special effects for button text - shadow and glow, each with
       variable intensity 0-2
    2) Changes to Navbutton::info() to handle renamed and additional fields
  1.0.2 (2010-07-19)
    1) Removed Navbutton::count_children() (believed unused)

    3) Removed member variable $states
    4) Navbutton::image_dropdown_indicator() now operates on instance variables
    5) Navbutton::delete() now does test to see if it was last remaining button
       in suite - if so, it deletes the container navsuite
    6) Removed 'maintain_size' argument for Navbutton::make_image() and
       Navbutton::image_generate() - no longer needed
    7) Removed 'add_arrow' parameters for Navbutton::image_generate() - irrelevant
    8) All images for buttons and button styles may now be absolute or relative
       (i.e. start with a ./ or a / for userfiles)
  1.0.1 (2010-03-06)
    1) Change suggested by Werner Peters -
       Navbutton::subnav_add() now sets all perms for '[ New Button ]' where
       system setting states new buttons have all user permissions by default.
       This does mean public can see it during transition, but does that matter?
    2) Constructor renamed __construct()
  1.0.0 (2009-07-02)
