  1.0.8 (2014-04-26)
    1) Events, Podcasts and News panels were not respecting the results limit settings
       passed to them by unified component parameters in this implementation -
       The passed CP names have now been corrected
  1.0.7 (2014-01-28)
    1) Added ; and newline and indent after js_onload code in
       Component_Combo_Tabber::_draw_section_tabs()
  1.0.6 (2013-11-18)
    1) New CP section_tab_order to allow determination of displayed order of tab
       controls
  1.0.5 (2013-11-11)
    1) Now handles condition where there is only one section shown and therefore
       no section tabs - when this happens onload js code now sets parent container
       to have the same height as the only section present
  1.0.4 (2013-11-02)
    1) Now uses draw_section_tab_buttons() and show_section_tab() which use
       setOnStage() for handling of current tab without making them invisible -
       this is so that audio players can calculate the correct size for controls
    2) Radical rewrite to bring up to date in terms of latest component methods
