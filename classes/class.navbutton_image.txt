  1.0.6 (2012-06-19)
    1) Moved Navbutton::get_text_size() into here
    2) Moved Navbutton::get_button_base_size() into here
    3) Now capitalises text for each line if the 'uppercase' flag is set
  1.0.5 (2011-08-05)
    1) Remapped old use of setColourIndex() to Image_Factory::setColorIndex
       in Navbutton_Image::_add_overlay() and Navbutton_Image::_remap_template_colors()
  1.0.4 (2011-08-04)
    1) Navbutton_Image::_set_palette() now uses Image_Factory::allocateColor()
  1.0.3 (2011-07-01)
    1) Changes to Navbutton_Image::_add_text_glow_state() and _add_text_shadow_state()
       to include two new intensity matrices and to make existing ones smoother
  1.0.2 (2011-03-29)
    1) Changes to Navbutton_Image::_add_button_style_overlay() to work with
       new sequence rules
  1.0.1 (2010-08-09)
    1) Bug fix for Navbutton_Image::_add_text_overlays() -
       was not correctly respecting text alignment following change to
       two text regions.
  1.0.0 (2010-07-27)
    1) Initial release - code moved here from Navbutton class
    2) Substantial optimisations for text and text effects:
       a) If alpha is 100%, second layer and merge are skipped
       b) For _add_text_effect_from_matrix(), all points with the same
          alpha level are now handled in a single pass:
          Formerly glow of 100% required 37 merges per button state, now
          takes just 4 to achieve the same result (around 1/10)
    3) If button has transparent colour on it anywhere, transparency is set
       and palette remains at 16.7 million
    4) If button does NOT require transparency, palette is reduced to max of 1024
       colours with no dithering or transparency.
    5) Net effect is that regular images are 20% SMALLER than before, while
       those with transparency are abou 150% larger but both have better
       effect rendering
