    1) No longer throws an exception if there's a filter set somewhere that
       doesn't apply to the report being operated upon in group wizard context -
       simply ignores it and moves on
  1.0.10 (2013-05-01)
    1) Now correctly applies query optimisations when working with reports that
       deal directly with records in the person table (i.e. users and contacts)
    2) Additional optimisations that speed up loading by several seconds on
       systems having many records
  1.0.9 (2013-04-23)
    1) Bug fix to avoid running subseqlect query when there are no persons
       selected in report

  1.0.7 (2011-10-03)
    1) Bug fix in Group_Wizard::_setup_get_targetIDs() to let select boxes work
       with objects other than Person -
       now works with group member, event registrations and custom registration
       sub-selects
  1.0.6 (2011-08-20)
    1) Removed groupAPPROVER and groupEDITOR permissions
  1.0.5 (2011-08-11)
    1) Change to Group_Wizard::_setup_get_targetIDs() to make subselect clause
       unambiguous - was failing

    1) Group_Wizard::draw() now calls HTML class for section tabs
  1.0.3 (2011-06-09)
    1) Replaced references to report columns of type 'button_add_to_group' with

      Group_Wizard::_setup_get_total_count() and Group_Wizard::_setup_get_targetIDs()
  1.0.2 (2011-06-04)
    1) Group_Wizard::_setup_get_targetIDs() now has no special clause for reports
       based on 'Person' object (we'll have Users, Contacts and eventually Subscribers)
       but instead the filter in the 'add_to_group' button definition in User report
       includes only one table to prevent abiguities from being encountered
  1.0.1 (2011-05-26)
    1) Group_Wizard::draw() changes to bottom buttons for consistency
